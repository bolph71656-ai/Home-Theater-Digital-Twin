# O100 — System Expansion / Virtual Channel Topology Optimization

> Status: **O100A–O100B implemented / O100C–O100G planned** — tracking: [Issue #142](https://github.com/bolph71656-ai/Home-Theater-Digital-Twin/issues/142) / implementations: [PR #144](https://github.com/bolph71656-ai/Home-Theater-Digital-Twin/pull/144), [PR #150](https://github.com/bolph71656-ai/Home-Theater-Digital-Twin/pull/150)
>
> O100 extends the existing N40 / G10 / O10–O90 / R-series authority. It does not replace them.
>
> Purpose: allow HTDT to answer questions such as:
>
> > “The current room has no SL/SR. Add virtual SL/SR, define where they may be installed, evaluate feasible placements, compare multiple system layouts, and determine which candidates are worth installing and measuring.”

## 1. Product goal

HTDT must support not only **optimization of objects that already exist**, but also **design-space expansion**.

Examples:

- current 3.0.2 → proposed 5.0.2 by adding SL/SR;
- current 5.0.2 → proposed 7.0.2 by adding SBL/SBR;
- compare one pair of wall-mounted surrounds vs another installation zone;
- compare two explicitly supplied speaker models for a new role;
- add a second subwoofer later and search its allowed region;
- compare “no added speaker” against one or more expansion variants;
- after installation, preserve the original proposal and create an As-built/Measured state.

The system must never pretend that a proposed speaker already exists physically or has been measured.

## 2. Distinguish four questions

O100 separates:

1. **Topology**
   - which roles/entities exist in the candidate system?
   - example: 3.0.2 vs 5.0.2.

2. **Equipment/source definition**
   - what physical/acoustic model represents each proposed speaker?

3. **Placement**
   - where may each proposed entity be installed?
   - height, orientation and aim are part of this search.

4. **Performance**
   - how does each exact topology/equipment/placement variant perform for supported objectives?

A result is not a valid O100 candidate unless all four layers can be traced exactly.

## 3. Relationship to existing authority

### N40

N40 already allows arbitrary speaker roles; 3.0.2 is a template/fixture, not a fixed schema.

O100 reuses this capability but adds proposal lifecycle and variant semantics.

### G10 / O10

Reuse:

- allowed region;
- exclusion region;
- wall clearance;
- cabinet clearance;
- pair distance;
- linked placement;
- axis/height bounds;
- movement/installation constraints.

O100 must not implement a second placement-constraint engine.

### O30 / O40

Reuse independent objective vectors and Pareto comparison.

Topology variants are never reduced to one hidden “system score”.

### O80

O80 remains the authority for supported extended placement parameters such as:

- acoustic aim;
- physical cabinet yaw/toe-in;
- height / multi-entity search when supported.

O100 supplies proposed entities/topologies to O10/O80; it does not duplicate extended-search logic.

### O90

O90 evaluates robustness of an exact O100 candidate against installation/input tolerances.

O100 asks:
> What system/placement variants should exist?

O90 asks:
> How sensitive is this exact candidate to realistic error?

### R-series

R110+ supplies source/directivity/material/environment capability.
R170/R180 determine which acoustic objectives are valid for production decisions.

O100 cannot unlock unsupported physics.

## 4. Lifecycle state

Every physical-system entity participating in a design decision has an explicit lifecycle state.

Initial states:

- `current`
  - entity exists in the currently modeled working system;
- `proposed`
  - hypothetical entity that does not yet exist physically;
- `as_built`
  - installed physical entity with recorded actual pose/configuration;
- `measured`
  - as-built entity/system with bound measurement evidence.

A UI badge may use natural Japanese labels, but persistence uses stable semantic states.

Rules:

- adding an SL/SR proposal does not mutate the current/as-built scene;
- a proposed entity has no physical measurement merely because its model has manufacturer data;
- installing a proposal creates a new As-built revision; it does not rewrite the old proposal;
- measured evidence binds to the exact As-built SceneRevision/AcquisitionContext;
- proposal → installed → measured is an append-only lineage.

## 5. Core authority objects

### 5.1 SystemVariant

Immutable record describing one complete candidate system.

Minimum identity:

- base SceneRevision/content hash;
- variant ID/name;
- parent variant if any;
- active channel-role set;
- proposed/current/as-built entity bindings;
- EquipmentDefinition/source-model bindings;
- signal/routing assumptions where required;
- constraint authority;
- exact placement candidate identity;
- prediction/model/objective identity;
- algorithm/version provenance.

Examples:

- `Current 3.0.2`;
- `5.0.2 / SL-SR side-wall zone A`;
- `5.0.2 / SL-SR rear-biased`;
- `5.0.2 / Speaker Model B`.

### 5.2 ProposedEntitySpec

Defines an entity not present in the baseline.

Stores:

- entity type;
- role;
- lifecycle=`proposed`;
- physical dimensions/envelope;
- acoustic reference definition;
- EquipmentDefinition/source model reference;
- placement authority;
- orientation/aim bounds;
- optional linked-pair/group relation;
- provenance and uncertainty.

A proposed entity is not stored as a fake measured speaker.

### 5.3 ChannelRoleBinding

A role is not inferred only from the entity label.

Store:

- stable role ID;
- user-facing display name;
- layout/profile authority if one is selected;
- source/routing semantics;
- paired/group relationship;
- optional angular/layout criterion reference;
- profile/version provenance.

Examples may include `SL`, `SR`, `SBL`, `SBR`, but the persistence model is not limited to a fixed hard-coded list.

### 5.4 EquipmentDefinition

O100 depends on an explicit equipment/source record rather than a product-name string.

Required/optional capability fields include:

- manufacturer/model/user-defined identity;
- cabinet dimensions;
- acoustic reference;
- directivity data/capability;
- valid frequency band;
- sensitivity/reference level if known;
- SPL/headroom data if known;
- mounting/clearance metadata;
- data source/version/hash;
- measured / manufacturer / inferred / analytic state;
- uncertainty.

Missing data remains missing.

## 6. Source/directivity capability

For a proposed SL/SR, HTDT may have:

1. **complex directional source data**
   - supports the strongest coherent directional claims within validated range;

2. **magnitude-only directivity**
   - may support coverage/magnitude objectives but not fabricated coherent phase;

3. **summary/polar data**
   - limited objectives;

4. **analytic/generic source model**
   - explicitly approximate;

5. **unknown**
   - objectives requiring directivity remain unavailable.

The UI must say what the proposal is based on.

Example:

> 「この候補は汎用90°指向モデルによる概算です。実機の位相・最大SPLは評価していません。」

## 7. LayoutProfile / standards relationship

O100 introduces the concept of a versioned `LayoutProfile` interface.

A profile may provide:

- known channel roles;
- placement-angle regions;
- height/elevation criteria;
- pairing/symmetry rules;
- optional seat/reference-point definitions;
- source/reference citation and version.

Examples may later include Dolby or RP22-derived evaluation profiles where the available source/rights permit.

Important:

- a LayoutProfile is an **evaluation/constraint source**, not physical truth;
- user-defined layout remains possible;
- no profile silently moves speakers;
- compliance is not the same as acoustic optimum;
- failing one profile criterion does not delete the candidate unless the user made it a hard constraint.

## 8. Search-space definition

O100 search starts from one or more proposed roles.

For each proposed speaker/entity:

- allowed region;
- exclusion region;
- minimum/maximum height;
- wall/ceiling/furniture clearance;
- cabinet envelope;
- orientation/yaw limits;
- acoustic aim limits;
- role-specific angular region if selected;
- distance limits;
- linked placement relation;
- installation-zone choice;
- equipment alternative choice if enabled.

Example SL/SR definition:

```text
SL:
  allowed zone: left-side wall region
  height: 1.1–1.6 m
  wall clearance: >= 0.10 m
  aim yaw: -20° … +20° relative to seat target

SR:
  derived by mirror relation from SL

pair:
  same model
  linked height
  optional left/right geometric symmetry
```

This definition is immutable for a search run.

## 9. Topology generation

O100 must not blindly enumerate every conceivable speaker configuration.

A `TopologySearchSpec` explicitly lists allowed topology operations.

Initial operations:

- add role/entity;
- remove proposed role/entity;
- replace equipment binding;
- choose one of explicit installation zones;
- activate/deactivate an explicitly defined optional pair/group.

Examples:

```text
baseline: 3.0.2
allowed variants:
  - baseline unchanged
  - + SL/SR
```

or:

```text
baseline: 5.0.2
allowed variants:
  - current
  - + SBL/SBR
  - replace SL/SR Model A with Model B
```

HTDT does not invent arbitrary channel layouts unless the user/profile explicitly places them in the topology search space.

## 10. Candidate identity

A candidate includes all decision dimensions that affect semantics.

At minimum:

- topology variant;
- role set;
- exact equipment binding;
- exact XYZ;
- physical orientation;
- acoustic aim;
- linked-pair derivation;
- constraint-set identity;
- layout-profile identity;
- solver/prediction authority;
- objective specification.

Changing equipment model at the same coordinates creates a different candidate.

Changing only camera/view does not.

## 11. Objective families

O100 reuses O30 objective semantics and only enables objectives backed by current capability.

### 11.1 Geometric/layout objectives

Possible without full acoustic solver if the required geometry is known:

- role angular placement;
- distance;
- height/elevation;
- symmetry;
- physical collision/clearance;
- installation-zone feasibility;
- cable/install distance later if authority exists.

### 11.2 Coverage objectives

Require adequate directivity authority.

Examples:

- per-seat on-axis/off-axis angle;
- useful coverage fraction;
- worst-seat directivity loss;
- seat-to-seat coverage spread;
- MLP vs secondary-seat trade-off.

### 11.3 SPL / headroom objectives

Require explicit source/equipment capability.

Examples:

- worst-seat target SPL margin;
- continuous/peak headroom where source data supports it;
- level variation across seats.

Unknown max SPL/sensitivity means the corresponding objective is unavailable.

### 11.4 Acoustic-response objectives

Use R-series/O30 authority when supported:

- FR/target deviation;
- peaks/nulls;
- seat variation;
- early reflections;
- decay/other observables only when validated.

### 11.5 Installation/complexity objectives

May include independently:

- number of added speakers;
- displacement/installation distance;
- mounting complexity;
- cable length estimate;
- equipment count/cost only if explicit user data exists.

Do not mix these into acoustic quality.

## 12. Multi-channel semantics

O100 must not compare different topologies using an undefined multi-channel sum.

Separate:

1. **per-channel/source transfer**
   - evaluate each role/source independently where appropriate;

2. **defined excitation scenario**
   - exact routing/gain/delay/filter/content assumption is stored;

3. **program-format/layout criteria**
   - evaluated as geometry/profile compliance, not as an invented acoustic waveform.

For coherent sums, phase/routing/timing must be known.
For unrelated program channels, HTDT must not create an arbitrary coherent sum and call it “system FR”.

## 13. Search strategy

Topology × equipment × placement can explode combinatorially.

Recommended staged pipeline:

```text
explicit topology variants
  -> geometric hard constraints
  -> layout/profile feasibility
  -> cheap coverage/directivity screening
  -> nominal acoustic screening
  -> O30/O40 Pareto shortlist
  -> common-fidelity acoustic reevaluation
  -> O90 robustness on surviving variants
  -> proposed installation / measurement plan
```

Rules:

- never use unsupported cheap models to eliminate a candidate from a stronger physics objective without a validated screening relationship;
- keep audit samples where screening is approximate;
- final compared candidates use compatible objective definitions and fidelity;
- budget-limited results remain preliminary.

## 14. Example: adding SL/SR

Baseline:

```text
Current system:
  FL / C / FR / TFL / TFR
  no SL / SR
```

O100 workflow:

1. create `SystemVariant: 5.0.2 proposal`;
2. add ProposedEntitySpec for SL/SR;
3. bind role definitions;
4. select or create EquipmentDefinition;
5. draw allowed installation zones in Room;
6. set height/clearance/aim/pair rules;
7. generate feasible O10/O80 placement candidates;
8. evaluate capability-gated objectives;
9. inspect Pareto candidates;
10. optionally run O90 robustness;
11. select one proposal;
12. apply it as a new proposed SceneRevision;
13. physically install;
14. record As-built pose/model;
15. create MeasurementPlan;
16. import REW evidence;
17. validate predictions against the exact installed state.

Baseline 3.0.2 remains available throughout.

## 15. SystemVariant comparison

The user must be able to compare:

- existing/current system;
- proposed topology A;
- proposed topology B;
- different equipment binding;
- different placement candidate;
- later, measured as-built system.

Comparison set keeps:

- exact SystemVariant;
- exact SceneRevision;
- source/equipment capability;
- objective vector;
- model/evidence;
- O90 robustness if available;
- validation/measured state.

A/B/C comparison is a decision object, not Undo history.

## 16. Proposed vs As-built promotion

Applying a SystemVariant to the scene does not mean it was installed.

Recommended transitions:

```text
Proposed
  -> selected for installation
  -> As-built
  -> Measured
```

At As-built transition:

- actual equipment identity is recorded;
- actual measured physical pose may differ from proposal;
- installation deviations are stored;
- old proposal remains immutable.

O90 can later compare the actual deviation with the planned tolerance envelope.

## 17. Interaction with O90

After an exact O100 candidate exists, O90 may perturb:

- proposed speaker XYZ;
- height;
- aim;
- physical yaw;
- listener position;
- later supported equipment/material/environment axes.

Example result:

```text
Variant A:
  nominal coverage: best
  ±20 mm placement sensitivity: high

Variant B:
  nominal coverage: slightly lower
  ±20 mm robustness: better
```

HTDT reports both facts.
It does not silently select B.

## 18. UI design

O100 integrates into the workflow-first shell.

### Room > スピーカー・座席

New actions:

- `スピーカーを追加`
- `仮想スピーカーとして追加`
- `役割を設定`
- `機種 / 音源モデルを設定`
- `配置可能範囲を設定`

Proposed entities:

- use ghost/outline treatment distinct from current/as-built;
- display `仮想` or `提案` badge;
- never look identical to measured installed entities.

### Optimize

Recommended sub-contexts:

- `探索設定`
- `構成比較`
- `候補`
- `比較`
- `ばらつき耐性`
- `測定・検証`

`構成比較` answers:

- which roles are added/removed;
- which equipment model is used;
- what placement region applies;
- which objectives are available/unavailable and why.

### Overview

Readiness may show:

- 「SL/SRは仮想構成です」
- 「SL/SRの音源モデルが未設定です」
- 「この機種では指向性データがないため全席coverageを評価できません」
- 「配置候補を計算できます」
- 「この案は未設置です」
- 「設置後に実測してください」

## 19. Command / deep-link additions

Candidate commands:

- `speaker.add_proposed`
- `speaker.assign_role`
- `speaker.assign_equipment`
- `optimization.system_variant.create`
- `optimization.topology_search.run`
- `optimization.variant.compare`
- `optimization.variant.apply`
- `system.mark_as_built`

Exact command IDs may be adjusted to the central command registry conventions, but logic must not be duplicated in widgets.

## 20. Persistence

At minimum persist:

- SystemVariant;
- TopologySearchSpec;
- ProposedEntitySpec;
- ChannelRoleBinding;
- EquipmentDefinition reference;
- per-entity PlacementConstraint binding;
- exact candidate coordinates/orientation/aim;
- variant ObjectiveVector;
- PredictionRun bindings;
- robustness references;
- installation/as-built transition record;
- measurement/validation references.

No result may be detached from the exact topology that produced it.

## 21. Fail-closed conditions

Do not produce a strong recommendation when:

- role/source mapping is ambiguous;
- proposed speaker has no model for the requested objective;
- directivity is required but unknown;
- SPL/headroom data is required but unknown;
- solver applicability does not cover the requested objective/band;
- the topology requires routing/excitation semantics that are undefined;
- comparison candidates were evaluated with incompatible fidelity/objective definitions;
- O90 robustness is requested outside its validated perturbation domain;
- production claim lacks required O60/R180 evidence.

Unavailable objective is shown as unavailable, not zero or a poor score.

## 22. Implementation slices

### O100A — SystemVariant / proposed lifecycle authority — implemented

Implemented in PR #144. The authority is intentionally limited to proposal topology/lifecycle and exact SceneRevision derivation; O100B placement search, O100C equipment/source capability, GUI, and new O90 semantics are not part of this slice.

- immutable SystemVariant;
- immutable ProposedEntitySpec;
- explicit current / proposed / as_built / measured lifecycle binding;
- versionable ChannelRoleBinding without a fixed role enum;
- exact add/remove/replace variant diff;
- baseline SceneRevision remains immutable;
- explicit selected-variant apply creates one new SceneRevision;
- proposal evidence survives apply through append-only variant/application lineage;
- WorkingDocument whole-scene replacement provides a one-Undo integration point;
- stable comparison reference exposes baseline/proposed/applied revision identity without implementing a new comparison score.

### O100B — topology + virtual placement search

- TopologySearchSpec;
- add/remove/replace explicit variant operations;
- per-proposed-entity allowed region;
- G10/O10 reuse;
- linked SL/SR pair;
- O80 aim/toe-in/height integration;
- deterministic candidate identity.

O100B was implemented in PR #150. It reuses O100A variants, O10 deterministic grid generation, G10 hard constraints and O80 orientation-aware body semantics; candidate conversion requires exact deterministic search membership and does not mutate the baseline SceneRevision. Equipment/source capability and performance objectives remain outside this slice.

### O100C — EquipmentDefinition/source capability

- source/equipment binding;
- physical dimensions;
- directivity tiers;
- sensitivity/SPL optional capability;
- data provenance;
- explicit unknown/inferred/measured states.

This should align with R110 rather than creating a competing acoustic-source authority.

### O100D — capability-gated system objectives

- layout/profile evaluation;
- coverage;
- worst-seat/seat spread;
- SPL/headroom;
- acoustic objectives;
- independent install/complexity objectives;
- O40 Pareto integration.

### O100E — multi-fidelity topology search

- geometric/profile screening;
- directivity/coverage screening;
- acoustic refinement;
- common-fidelity final comparison;
- cache/scheduler reuse;
- audit trail for approximate pruning.

### O100F — O90 robust system expansion

- exact O100 candidate → O90 RobustnessSpec;
- placement/aim tolerance;
- nominal vs robust variant comparison;
- 3D tolerance overlays for proposed entities.

### O100G — UX / as-built / measurement loop

- proposed-speaker Room workflow;
- system-variant comparison;
- Japanese-first copy;
- proposal ghost visuals;
- selected variant apply;
- As-built transition;
- MeasurementPlan;
- measured/validated comparison.

## 23. Acceptance

### O100-A01 — baseline immutable

Create a 5.0.2 proposed variant from a 3.0.2 baseline.
Baseline SceneRevision remains unchanged.

### O100-A02 — arbitrary role

Add SL/SR without changing the persistent speaker schema to a fixed 5.0.2 schema.

### O100-A03 — proposed state

SL/SR are clearly persisted/rendered as proposed, not measured/current.

### O100-A04 — linked allowed region

Define independent left/right zones or mirrored linked placement and deterministically regenerate the same feasible candidate set.

### O100-A05 — hard constraints

Proposed speaker candidates re-run room/allowed/exclusion/wall/pair/cabinet constraints.

### O100-A06 — source capability gate

Without directivity data, coverage objective is unavailable instead of fabricated.

### O100-A07 — equipment identity

Changing only SL/SR EquipmentDefinition changes candidate/SystemVariant semantic identity.

### O100-A08 — topology comparison

Compare current 3.0.2 and proposed 5.0.2 without treating missing SL/SR response in baseline as numeric zero.

### O100-A09 — multi-channel semantics

Per-channel analysis and explicitly defined excitation scenarios remain distinct; undefined coherent multi-channel sum is rejected.

### O100-A10 — Pareto

Topology/placement variants retain independent objectives and no hidden overall score is required.

### O100-A11 — common-fidelity final comparison

Final variants are re-evaluated under compatible model/objective/fidelity before final comparison is claimed.

### O100-A12 — O90 integration

An exact SL/SR candidate can be passed into O90 without changing O90 uncertainty semantics.

### O100-A13 — apply

Selecting a proposed variant creates one new SceneRevision and preserves the previous system for comparison/Undo/history.

### O100-A14 — As-built transition

Installing the proposal creates As-built state and preserves proposed coordinates/model as historical evidence.

### O100-A15 — measurement binding

REW measurements can bind only after a real AcquisitionContext/SceneRevision exists; proposed SL/SR never gain fake measured evidence.

### O100-A16 — UX

A user can complete:

```text
current system
→ add virtual SL/SR
→ draw install zones
→ choose speaker/source model
→ run placement search
→ compare candidates
→ inspect robust tolerance
→ select proposal
```

without internal schema IDs or manual database editing.

## 24. Product-completion definition

For this class of workflow, HTDT is product-complete only when it can preserve the full chain:

```text
Current physical system
  ↓
Proposed topology
  ↓
Proposed equipment/source
  ↓
Allowed installation space
  ↓
Feasible placement candidates
  ↓
Capability-gated prediction
  ↓
Multi-objective / Pareto comparison
  ↓
O90 tolerance robustness
  ↓
Selected proposal
  ↓
As-built physical state
  ↓
REW measurement
  ↓
Prediction-vs-measurement validation
```

The key distinction is that a proposal is useful before hardware exists, but becomes a strong real-room recommendation only when the relevant model/evidence gates support the claim.

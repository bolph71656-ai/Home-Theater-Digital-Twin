# O60E Owned-Room Validation Campaign

Tracking: Issue #81

## Problem

O60 software validation already separates calibration and holdout inside a
ValidationRecord, but the split can currently be supplied when the record is
built. For real owned-room evidence that permits choosing holdout candidates
after observing measurements.

O60E preregisters the study before candidate measurements are completed. O70
must not consume an owned-room validation that is not tied to such a persisted
campaign.

## Immutable campaign authority

A campaign freezes:

- document, SearchSpec id/SHA and candidate-set SHA;
- model id/version;
- requested validation band and holdout residual threshold;
- candidate ids and calibration/holdout split;
- canonical target response, reference/excluded bands, objective-evaluation spec/SHA and objective ids;
- trend tolerances/minimum comparable pairs/minimum agreement ratio;
- sensitivity candidate pairs and thresholds;
- candidates requiring repeated measurements and minimum repeat count;
- candidate-separation pairs and repeatability reference candidate;
- required applicability check codes;
- creation timestamp and campaign identity SHA.

The repository regenerates the exact SearchSpec candidate set before saving and
rejects unknown candidate ids or a changed candidate-set SHA.

For every candidate in the campaign, a measured Measurement Plan must not
already exist at campaign-save time. Planned-but-not-measured plans are allowed
because they can be prepared before physical measurement. This prevents
post-measurement split selection.

## Readiness

Readiness is derived from immutable repositories and never creates or
reclassifies evidence. For each campaign candidate it reports:

- one exact completed Room Simulator prediction attempt for the campaign model;
- one completed Measurement Plan and its measured N60 evidence;
- predicted/measured objective evaluations whose evaluation-spec SHA exactly
  equals the preregistered campaign spec;
- repeatability count for candidates that require repeated measurements;
- measurement capture time must be after campaign preregistration;
- measured provenance must contain `validation_scope=owned_room` and the exact campaign id.

Missing or ambiguous evidence is listed explicitly. No default ranking or
automatic physical action is performed.

## Native owned-room measurement ingestion

Normal N60 import remains generic measurement ingestion and does not become
owned-room validation evidence automatically.

The optimization workspace exposes an explicit
`選択REW→Campaign実測` action. It is available only when:

- a persisted campaign is selected;
- a planned Measurement Plan for one of that campaign's candidates is selected;
- the current clean SceneRevision exactly equals the plan's applied revision;
- the REW measurement is read through the API path.

That action freezes `evidence_type=measured`, `validation_scope=owned_room`
and the exact campaign id into measurement provenance. REW text import is not
promoted to O60E evidence because it does not provide a trustworthy capture
timestamp.

REW 5.40 may expose a local wall-clock date without an offset, for example
`2026-Sep-16 12:11:10`. Because the supported REW API is localhost on the
owned Windows machine, the adapter interprets that legacy form with the host's
local timezone rules for the measurement date, stores an offset-aware ISO
timestamp, and preserves both the raw date and interpretation source in
provenance. An already offset-aware source timestamp is preserved.


## Validation build

Owned-room full validation is built from the persisted campaign. Candidate split
and thresholds come from the campaign, not from a caller-supplied BuildSpec.

Evidence selection is deterministic and fail-closed:

- the response measurement for a candidate is the earliest captured measured
  evidence in its completed Measurement Plan;
- prediction requires exactly one matching completed attempt, otherwise
  readiness is ambiguous;
- objective evidence requires exactly one matching predicted and one matching
  measured evaluation for each objective and campaign evaluation-spec SHA;
- repeatability uses all measured evidence in the campaign candidate plan;
- required applicability codes must be supplied exactly once when the record is
  built;
- applicability checks are never auto-passed. The native UI exposes
  `未確認/PASS/FAIL` for geometry, band and routing, and requires a written
  confirmation detail for every PASS.

A resulting owned-room ValidationRecord stores the campaign id and SHA. The
validation repository independently rechecks the campaign, candidate split,
objective-evaluation spec, thresholds, sensitivity/repeatability/separation
requirements, applicability codes, capture time and measurement campaign
provenance before persistence. The same binding is rechecked when O70 asks for
the latest eligible record.

## O70 boundary

The O70 entry API may return only a persisted `eligible` ValidationRecord whose
owned-room campaign exists and matches the record. Synthetic fixtures and legacy
owned-room records without a campaign never open the automatic-recommendation
gate.

## Non-goals

- no autonomous speaker movement;
- no autonomous REW playback;
- no synthetic promotion to owned-room evidence;
- no adaptive planner implementation before a genuine campaign passes O60.

## Authority boundary

`StandardsProfile` is immutable and versioned. Each criterion carries its own source
publisher, document title/version, reference, quantity, unit, applicable domain, required
inputs/capabilities, evidence requirement, comparison operator, boundary inclusivity, and
numeric angle semantics.

`StandardsEvaluation` binds the exact profile semantic hash to one exact
`SceneRevision` and, when applicable, one exact `SystemVariant` semantic hash and an
explicit set of target entity IDs. Each `CriterionObservation` may additionally bind the
exact entity subset that produced that criterion value; those entity IDs must be a subset
of the evaluation target. The repository re-validates those bindings before persistence. A newer profile creates a new evaluation linked by `reevaluation_of_id`; it
never rewrites the historical profile or evaluation.

The evaluator consumes explicit observations. It does **not** derive a missing physical
quantity, infer a missing capability, or invent a tolerance. Missing required
input/capability/evidence is `UNKNOWN`. A domain that does not apply is
`NOT_APPLICABLE`. Those states are not aliases for `FAIL`.

There is intentionally no aggregate compliance score. Criterion results are independent
records:

- `PASS`: the supplied observation satisfies the exact encoded rule.
- `FAIL`: the supplied observation does not satisfy the exact encoded rule.
- `UNKNOWN`: required input, capability, evidence, unit, or observed value is not
  sufficient to make the comparison.
- `NOT_APPLICABLE`: the criterion's declared domain does not apply, or the caller
  explicitly marks the criterion not applicable.

`predicted` and `measured` evidence remain distinct in the result. A predicted
`PASS` is not renamed or promoted to a measurement-verified `PASS`.

## Explicit hard-constraint interface

Compliance is advisory by default. A `FAIL` does not remove a candidate or mutate an
O30/O40/O90/O100 objective. Hard-constraint selection is not stored in, and does not
change, the `StandardsEvaluation` identity. Only criterion IDs explicitly supplied as
`selected_criterion_ids` to `explicit_hard_constraint_gate()` participate in the
downstream gate.

For a selected hard criterion, `FAIL` and `UNKNOWN` block downstream use. An
unselected `FAIL` never blocks. `NOT_APPLICABLE` does not block. This is a separate
gate; it is not a hidden Pareto objective or combined score.

## Deterministic numeric semantics

- JSON identity is canonicalized with sorted keys, UTF-8, compact separators, and
  non-finite JSON numbers forbidden.
- Profile semantic identity covers the exact criterion definitions and source provenance.
- Evaluation identity covers the profile ID/version/hash, exact scene/variant/entity
  binding, observations/evidence, and optional re-evaluation lineage. Downstream
  hard-constraint selection is deliberately excluded from evaluation identity.
- Floating-point comparison uses the decimal string representation of the supplied finite
  number. No epsilon is introduced.
- Every lower/upper boundary records inclusive/exclusive semantics.
- Angle rules explicitly select no wrap, signed `[-180, 180)`, or unsigned
  `[0, 360)` normalization. Absolute-angle comparison is explicit.
- `created_at_utc` is record metadata, not evaluation semantics; repeating the exact
  profile + target + evidence yields the same deterministic evaluation ID/hash.

## Built-in public-source profiles

The built-in data live in `backend/src/htdt/cad_standards_profiles.py`; the evaluator is
separate in `cad_standards.py`. Built-ins are deliberately incomplete where a public
source does not provide an explicit pass/fail boundary that HTDT can encode without
inventing one.

### CEDIA/CTA-RP22 v1.2 — spatial/layout subset

Source:

- CEDIA / Consumer Technology Association, **CEDIA/CTA-RP22 Recommended Practice for
  Immersive Audio Design**, v1.2, September 2023.
- Public source:
  <https://cedia.org/site/assets/files/6057/cedia-cta_rp22_v1_2_sept_2023.pdf>

HTDT provides separate profile identities for Levels 1–4:
`cedia-cta-rp22-spatial-level-{1..4}`, version `1.2-2023-09`.

Encoded criteria:

| Criterion ID | RP22 reference | Encoded rule |
|---|---|---|
| `rp22.p01.listener-boundary-distance` | Appendix A Parameter 1; §4.1.4 | listener-to-boundary distance strictly > 0.5 / 0.8 / 1.2 / 1.5 m for Levels 1/2/3/4 |
| `rp22.p03.screen-speakers-outside-zone-count` | Appendix A Parameter 3; §5.5.4 | 0 screen-wall speakers outside recommended zones |
| `rp22.p05.max-adjacent-surround-horizontal-angle` | Appendix A Parameter 5; §5.6.2.1 | max 80° / 60° / 50° for Levels 2/3/4; omitted for Level 1 where Appendix A is N/A |
| `rp22.p07.wide-horizontal-median-deviation` | Appendix A Parameter 7; §5.7 | max absolute deviation 10° / 7° / 5° / 2° for Levels 1/2/3/4 |
| `rp22.p08.upfiring-elevation-speakers-prohibited` | Appendix A Parameter 8; §5.8.2 | Levels 3/4 require `uses_upfiring_elevation_speakers == false`; Levels 1/2 are omitted because “allowed” is not a requirement to use them |
| `rp22.p09.max-adjacent-upper-vertical-angle` | Appendix A Parameter 9; §5.8.2 | max 80° / 60° / 50° for Levels 2/3/4; omitted for Level 1 where Appendix A is N/A |
| `rp22.p11.surround-wide-upper-outside-zone-count` | Appendix A Parameter 11; §5.9.3 | 0 speakers outside recommended zones for Levels 2/3/4; omitted for Level 1 where Appendix A is N/A |

This is explicitly a **spatial/layout subset**, not an RP22 room certification. RP22
contains additional criteria including acoustic performance/SPL-related requirements.
Issue #170 does not implement O100D coverage/SPL/headroom objectives, and this profile
must not imply those unimplemented criteria passed. Criteria that depend on recommended
zones also require the explicit `rp22-recommended-zone-evaluation-v1` capability; without
it they evaluate to `UNKNOWN`.

- Public source:
  <https://www.dolby.com/siteassets/technologies/dolby-atmos/atmos-installation-guidelines-121318_r3.1.pdf>
- Encoded reference: Figure 12, page 28, 5.1.2 speaker placement.

Profile identity: `dolby-atmos-home-5.1.2-layout`, version
`r3.1-2018-12-13`.

Encoded source ranges are 22°–30° for front left/right and 90°–110° for surround
left/right. HTDT maps them into its explicit signed azimuth convention: 0° points toward
the screen/front, positive angles point toward +X/right, negative angles toward -X/left,
and values normalize to [-180°, 180°). Therefore FL is -30°..-22°, FR is +22°..+30°,
SL is -110°..-90°, and SR is +90°..+110°. Endpoints are inclusive because the published
figure presents those endpoints as the placement range. This is a coordinate mapping, not
an added tolerance.

The profile intentionally does not infer top-speaker, elevation, room, or performance
criteria not encoded by this profile.

### AURO-3D Home Theater Setup Rev.12

Source:

  16 May 2024.
- Public source:
  <https://www.auro-3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Auro-3D-Home-Theater-Setup-Guidelines-v12-20240516.pdf>
- Encoded references: §3.3.1.1 (pages 23–24) and §3.3.2 Table 3 “Normative Speaker Positions” (page 26).

Profile identity: `auro3d-home-layout`, version `rev12-2024-05-16`.

Encoded criteria are limited to unambiguous public min/max statements:

| Criterion ID | Source rule encoded |
|---|---|
| `auro.v12.lower-layer-max-elevation` | lower-layer elevation maximum 10°; no unstated lower bound |
| `auro.v12.height-layer-elevation` | Height-layer elevation 25°–40° |
| `auro.v12.top-speaker-elevation` | Top speaker elevation 65°–100° |
| `auro.v12.surround-height-opening-angle` | Surround-to-Height opening angle at least 25° |
| `auro.v12.screen-height-opening-angle` | Height screen-channel opening angle at least 22° |

The Rev.12 table also publishes horizontal azimuth rows. HTDT does not encode those rows
in this initial profile because the published Height Right row contains an apparent sign
inconsistency in its maximum azimuth entry. The source is not silently corrected.

### DTS:X

No built-in DTS:X criterion is included in Issue #170 because an official public source
with a sufficiently explicit criterion boundary/provenance was not established for this
slice.

Users can represent an independently sourced criterion through
`build_user_standards_profile()`; every such criterion still requires explicit source
metadata, version, reference, unit, rule, evidence requirements, and capability
prerequisites.

## Persistence and re-evaluation

`CadStandardsRepository` stores profiles and evaluations append-only in the native CAD
SQLite database, after the existing native schema compatibility gate. It reuses
`SceneRepository` and `CadSystemVariantRepository`; it does not create a second
scene/layout truth.

Persistence checks include:

1. the exact profile ID/version/hash exists;
2. the evaluation re-generates identically through the current declared evaluator
   authority;
3. the exact SceneRevision ID/document/content hash exists;
4. an optional SystemVariant ID/hash belongs to that exact baseline SceneRevision;
5. evaluation target entity IDs exist in the exact scene or materialized variant;
6. each criterion observation's entity IDs are an exact subset of that target binding;
7. an explicit re-evaluation points to a persisted historical evaluation with the exact
   same target.

Reopening reads the serialized immutable payload and re-runs its model hash validation.
A duplicate semantic evaluation may carry a later attempted timestamp, but the repository
returns the original stored record because timestamp metadata is not part of the
deterministic criterion result identity.

## Deferred / out of scope

Issue #170 does not implement:

- overall RP22 certification or a hidden total compliance score;
- O100D coverage, SPL, headroom, worst-seat, or other acoustic objectives;
- automatic conversion of criterion results into Pareto objectives;
- automatic candidate deletion based on advisory `FAIL`;
- GUI;
- private/commercial document content that is not available in the cited public source;
- inferred DTS:X tolerances or silent repair of ambiguous/inconsistent source data;
- physical geometry/measurement derivation engines for every criterion. Those providers
  must declare their own input/evidence capability before a criterion can move from
  `UNKNOWN`.
